On Xavier's first day in NYC, we observe a blend of excitement, anxiety, and the pressures of adjusting to college life. The tone across the tweets reflects the overwhelming nature of his new environment, balancing between social interaction, academic stress, and the reality of independent living.

Key Themes:

Environmental Adjustment: Xavier's first impressions of Lipton Hall and the subway highlight the stark difference between what he's familiar with and the bustling chaos of NYC:
"Lipton Hall’s not bad, but there’s this weird smell in the hallway. Is that normal?"
"Took the subway this morning and someone was literally doing karaoke in the car. Welcome to NYC, I guess."
These early experiences signal that Xavier is already grappling with the fast-paced and sometimes strange urban environment.

Academic Overload: Despite it being the first day, the academic load hits hard, especially with subjects like computer science and calculus:
"Intro to Comp Sci is already killing me, and it’s day 1. Why did I think this was a good idea?"
This academic pressure will likely increase his stress levels, which will continue to influence his emotional state.

Social Anxiety vs. Curiosity: Xavier faces internal conflict regarding social interactions. While he feels the need to connect, he also struggles with the pressure to meet new people:
"I’m thinking about skipping the dorm social tonight. I’m not in the mood to ‘meet new people’ right now."
On the flip side, he appreciates the moments when connections happen naturally:
"Made a couple of friends in class today. Weird how fast you can click with people. College might not be that bad after all."

Homesickness and Isolation: Xavier’s sense of nostalgia emerges as he reflects on life back home, especially when faced with the realities of dorm living and missing his family:
"Lowkey miss my mom’s cooking. The dining hall food is… questionable."
"Feel like I haven’t heard from my high school friends in forever. Funny how fast life changes."

Mental Exhaustion and Self-Doubt: The final tweets of the day introduce a more introspective Xavier, questioning his choices and place in this new life:
"Anyone else already rethinking their entire life plan, or just me?"
"Does anyone else feel like they don’t belong here, or is that just my brain messing with me?"

Xavier’s first day reflects a typical freshman experience of sensory overload and uncertainty. The emotional engine is already responding to environmental factors (rain, social anxiety, academic stress), and this tension will guide his growth as he continues navigating his new life.
