Introduction

Xavier centers on the life of Xavier, a fictional 18-year-old from Queens, New York, who starts his adult journey just after graduating high school. The simulation begins at a pivotal moment in Xavier’s life as he navigates the early stages of adulthood. Initially enrolled in college, he soon faces the broader life challenges of securing a job, finding love, and building a family. Over time, Xavier experiences the highs and lows of career progression, parenthood, and the inevitability of aging.

Xavier’s life is documented through his simulated Twitter account, Xavier, where he expresses his thoughts, emotions, and observations. His tweets range from short, casual updates to longer, introspective reflections, offering a snapshot into the mind of a young adult growing older in a dynamic world.

Key Elements of the Simulation

Age Progression
Xavier begins at 18 years old and ages one year every two real-world days. Over the span of 108 days, he experiences 54 years of life, from young adulthood to the age of 72. The timeline is designed to capture life’s major phases, including early adulthood, mid-life, and senior years, within a highly condensed framework. This accelerated aging allows for an analysis of how decisions and experiences shape a person’s emotional and intellectual growth over time.

Daily Life Representation
Xavier’s life unfolds through a series of tweets, simulating how a real person might document their day-to-day experiences on social media. These tweets touch on various aspects of his life, including:

Early career struggles and victories

Relationship dynamics, both romantic and platonic

Reflections on personal growth and the passage of time

Milestones like marriage, parenthood, and career achievements

Periods of emotional highs and lows, including joy, frustration, and grief

The content and length of Xavier’s tweets vary to replicate the erratic nature of human expression. While some tweets may be lighthearted or observational, others delve deeper into personal musings or emotional reactions to life’s challenges.

Emotional and Cognitive Development
Throughout his life, Xavier’s emotional landscape is shaped by both external events and personal reflection. Starting with a sense of mild optimism typical of an 18-year-old entering adulthood, Xavier’s emotional responses shift with time. Successes in his career or relationships lift his spirits, while failures or loss generate frustration, sadness, or introspection. These emotional changes are reflected in the tone and content of his tweets, capturing the natural ebb and flow of human emotions.

Relationship Dynamics
Over time, Xavier forms, maintains, and sometimes loses relationships with those around him. Initially, his social circle is made up of a few close friends from his teenage years and new acquaintances from early adulthood. As the simulation progresses, these relationships evolve, with some becoming lifelong connections, while others fade due to distance, changing priorities, or personal conflict. Xavier also experiences love, marriage, and the challenges of family life, eventually becoming a father. The richness of these relationships adds depth to the experiment, showing how social interactions impact an individual over time.

Career and Personal Milestones
Beyond his academic years, Xavier navigates the workforce, building a career in technology and experiencing the challenges of professional growth. From job interviews to promotions, workplace stress to eventual career satisfaction, the simulation captures the tension between personal ambition and the need for balance in life. These career experiences shape Xavier’s self-identity, and his reflections on work-life balance, financial stability, and long-term goals are shared through his tweets.

Family Life and Aging
As Xavier grows older, new life phases emerge: meeting a partner, getting married, raising children, and eventually becoming a grandparent. His tweets capture both the joy and difficulties of family life, from the excitement of a new relationship to the pressures of parenting. In the later stages of life, Xavier reflects on aging, health, and mortality, bringing the simulation full circle as he approaches the end of his life at age 72.
