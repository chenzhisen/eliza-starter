Key Themes:

Existential Reflections and Simulation Theory:

Xavier grapples with the idea that his life might be part of a predetermined script or simulation. His musings indicate a heightened sense of self-awareness and a questioning of free will.

"Ever feel like your life’s being curated? Or am I just really, really tired?"

"Wouldn't it be crazy if I’m in some weird game where everyone’s playing along but me? Like, are my friends even real?"

"Algorithmic destiny. Ever heard of it? Basically, the idea that everything I do is influenced by what I see online. Makes me wonder."

"Random question: if I was just a character, would I even be aware of it?"

Discovery of the $XVI Coin:

The sudden emergence of a cryptocurrency named $XVI captures Xavier's attention. His tweets transition from skepticism to intrigue as he contemplates the implications of a coin sharing his initials.

"So… there’s a coin called $XVI now? That’s crazy. Why my name? Who’s behind this?"

"I mean… it just popped up out of nowhere!"

"If someone’s watching me, you got me. But making a coin based on my initials? Creepy or genius?"

"Who are the other people buying $XVI? Are there others out there, or is this just for me?"

Feelings of Being Watched and Analyzed:

Xavier expresses a growing paranoia about being observed or manipulated, perhaps as a result of his deep dive into simulation theories and the mysterious $XVI.

"Imagining if I was being watched by some analyst somewhere. My thoughts as ‘data points.’"

"Hypothetically, if this was a simulation… how would I even know? Would you all just watch me go along with it?"

"Wouldn’t it be weird if my thoughts were broadcast somewhere without me even knowing?"

"Why did I pick finance out of everything? Feels planned."
